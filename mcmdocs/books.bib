  abstract = { The relationship between lightning strike density, vegetation, and elevation was investigated at three different spatial scales: (i) interior Alaska (~630 000 km2), (ii) six longitudinal transects (~100 000 km2), and (iii) 17 individual physiographic subregions (~50 000 km2) within Alaska. The data consisted of 14 years (1986~1999) of observations by the Alaska Fire Service lightning strike detection network. The best explanation for the variation in lightning strike density was provided by a combination of the areal coverage of boreal forest and elevation. Each of these factors has the potential to influence the convective activity. Our study suggests that in a region that is climatically favorable for air-mass thunderstorms, surface properties may enhance local lightning storm development in the boreal forest. Lightning strikes were found to occur frequently both in mountainous areas and at river flats, which is contrary to results from previous Alaskan studies. }

  abstract    = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}
